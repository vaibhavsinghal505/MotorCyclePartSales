# Analyzing Motorcycle Part Sales
In this project, I developed an SQL query to calculate the monthly net revenue generated by each product line per warehouse. 
The query aggregates the difference between the total revenue and the payment fee to determine the net revenue for each product line. 
The data is grouped by product line, month (displayed as 'June', 'July', and 'August'), and warehouse, and the results are sorted by product line, month, and net revenue in descending order. 
The final output, saved as revenue_by_product_line, provides a clear view of the performance of each product line across different warehouses and months.
